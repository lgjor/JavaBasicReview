# Adding values

Write a method named addValueByIndex.

The method should take an array of longs and add a value to the specified element by its index.

Here is a description of the parameters:

an array of longs;
the index of an element (int);
a value for adding (long).
The method must return nothing.

The following invocation should work correctly:

addValueByIndex(array, index, value);
Explain code
Where array is an array of longs, index is an integer variable, value is a long value for adding.
