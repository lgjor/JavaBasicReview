Stop, yield, go: Traffic conductor's waltz

Design a basic traffic light controller. Create methods to handle different light states (red, yellow, green) and cycle through them. The main method should simulate the traffic light cycle. Input is the current state (0 for red, 1 for yellow, 2 for green), and output is the next state and action.

## Sample Input 1:

0

### Sample Output 1:

1
Change to Yellow

## Sample Input 2:

1

### Sample Output 2:

2
Change to Green
