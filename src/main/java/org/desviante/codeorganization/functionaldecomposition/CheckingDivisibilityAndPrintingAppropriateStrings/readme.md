# Checking divisibility and printing appropriate strings

Write a Java program that takes an integer as an input. If the number is divisible by 3, it should print 'Fizz', and if it's divisible by 5, it should print 'Buzz'. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'. For any other integer, just print 'None'. You need to create separate methods to check divisibility by 3, 5 and both.

## Sample Input 1:

3

### Sample Output 1:

Fizz

## Sample Input 2:

5

### Sample Output 2:

Buzz
