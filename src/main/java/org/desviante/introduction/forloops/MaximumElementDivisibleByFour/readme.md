# Maximum element divisible by four

Given a sequence of natural numbers, not exceeding 30000. Find the maximum element divisible by 4. There is always an element divisible by 4 in the sequence and the number of elements does not exceed 1000.

As input, the program receives the number of elements in the sequence n (first line) and then the elements themselves (next n lines). The program should print a single number: the maximum element of the sequence divisible by 4.

Try to solve this problem by using a for-loop.
