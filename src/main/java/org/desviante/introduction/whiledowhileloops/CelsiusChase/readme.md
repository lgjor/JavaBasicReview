# Celsius Chase: Climbing to a Fiery Halt

Write a Java program that reads a sequence of temperature readings in degrees Celsius until a reading of 100 degrees or more is encountered. Your program should output the highest temperature reading observed up to that point. You must take input as a sequence of integer temperature values and print the highest value before the stopping condition.

_HINT: Assume you are dealing only with positive temperatures._
