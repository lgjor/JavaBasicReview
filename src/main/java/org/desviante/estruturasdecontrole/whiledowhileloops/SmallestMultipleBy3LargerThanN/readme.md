# Finding the smallest multiple of 3 larger than 'n'

Given a positive integer 'n', print the smallest number 'x' that is greater than or equal to 'n' which is a multiple of 3. Use a while loop to generate a sequence of natural numbers, starting from 'n', and then find the smallest number in this sequence that is a multiple of 3. Use the modulus (%) operator to check for a multiple of 3, if 'x' modulo 3 equals 0 then 'x' is a multiple of 3. Print -1 if 'n' is not a positive integer.
