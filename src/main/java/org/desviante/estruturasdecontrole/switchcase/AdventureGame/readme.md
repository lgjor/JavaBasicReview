# Adventure game

Here's an example of a switch statement as part of a text-based adventure game. In this example, the switch statement is used to handle different player choices within the game. The program prints the part of the story and, based on his choice, outputs the continuation of the story. Decide which choice refers to which output and fill in the blanks in the switch statement.
